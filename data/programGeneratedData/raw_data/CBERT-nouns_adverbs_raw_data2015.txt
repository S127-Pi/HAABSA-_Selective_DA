front of house staff
-1
each time we 've been , the front of house staff ( not the waiters - they 're fantastic - but the people who greet and seat you ) has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional $T$ i would never return .

as $T$ does n't take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar - and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated , which can be over an hour later !

the frizzy retro $T$ ( with winged/ dame edna glasses ) will yell at you if you try to order a drink .

there 's another $T$ who i ca n't describe , she is about 5 ' 6 '' with brown hair , who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said , so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you 're * really * talking about .

considering you will spend at least $ 60 a head , i expect better $T$ .

this guy refused to seat her and she left , followed shortly by the four of us , but not before i told him that in my 40 years of world travel , including paris , that i had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a $T$ in a restaurant .

a word to the wise : you ca n't dine here and disturb the $T$ 's sense of `` table turnover '' , as whacked as it is , or else .

at first glance this place seems a bit pricey for a hot dog joint , but at $T$ you do n't just get your average hot dog .

mistakes happen , but they are usually accompanied by an apology , perhaps even a glass of wine ... but not the grunt that we received from the al di la $T$ .

the $T$ came to check in on us every few minutes , and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating ( a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere , so i try to ignore it ) .

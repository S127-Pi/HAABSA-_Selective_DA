after one member of our party had been bumped repeatedly by a $T$ , a polite request that he not be bumped sent the $T$ into an abusive rant .

a brief conversation with the $T$ at the end of the meal was the greatest disappointment -- to say we had been `` blown off '' would be an understatement .

the $T$ continually interrupted with `` is there anything else i can do for you ? `` , a strange comment because she had hardly listened , let alone responded to our expression of disappointment at our experience .

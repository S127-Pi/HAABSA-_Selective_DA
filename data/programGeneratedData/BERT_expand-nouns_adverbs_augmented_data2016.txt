there 's another $T$ who i ca n't describe , she is about 5 ' 6 '' with brown hair , who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said , so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you 're * really * talking about .

here's another $T$ that you can't describe, who is about 5 ' 6 '' with brown eyes, she eavesdrops on the speech and tunes in - except - only hears the last words of everything i said, so such uninvited comments are taken out of session and have to do with that they're * really * talking about.

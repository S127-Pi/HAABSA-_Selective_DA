yes , the $T$ is classy and beautiful , but they most certainly target the uber whealthy not the common joe that wants to go all out every once in a while .

$T$ has history and it is a sort of landmark of new york city restaurants , but trust me , they will charge you through the nose just so that you can say `` i 've been to $T$ restaurant '' .

also , $T$ try to push more food on you , like suggest things as if they are complimentary when they actually cost $ .

however , once i received my predictably mediocre order of what dokebi thinks passes as korean fair , ( sometimes you have to settle when it 's your only option ) , i got through about half my $T$ before i found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting , slimy , clearly bad piece of fish skin .

my main concern was the sanity of the $T$ that was being sent out to myself and others , but i would be lying is i said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen i was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation .
